Final Project Documentation

My project is called “Cross the Fields.” To run it, simply run the “Main.java” file, then start the game by pressing the button on the title screen. 
You can load any level of the game you wish (except the first) using the load option at the top of the window. 

"These monsters are everywhere! How will I ever get back?"
Your character is a black dot, “Soldier,” who starts at the left of the screen at the start of every level. 
You can move him around by using WASD keys, including moving diagonally by pressing two buttons at once. 
If you click somewhere, Soldier will shoot exactly at that location, allowing for precise shooting.
He wields a semiautomatic rifle and will shoot every time you click. Any enemy will die immediately with one shot.

"Grr!"
The blue triangles with red lines are “Drillhounds,” or TriangleEnemy in the java documentation. 
They will always charge directly at the Soldier, even bashing against walls in their attempt to do so.
Don’t let down your guard, because they can kill Soldier instantly and can sometimes drill their way through the walls.
*There are PINK variants which move much faster.*

"Pew pew!"
The yellow triangles are “Turrets,” or SquareEnemy in the java. 
They will shoot at the soldier, though they don’t move. 
You can dodge their bullets if you’re fast enough.
*There are ORANGE variants which shoot wall-piercing bullets.*

"(Thorns bristling with malicious intent)"
The green circles are “Cactimpalers,” or CircleEnemy in the java.
They serve as deadly obstacles, and your enemies can shoot through them. 
If enemies are behind a cactus, you need to shoot the cactimpaler first.
*There are GRAY variants which will explode and kill you if you approach within a circle's length of them, and cannot be shot*

To complete a level, you need to cross the screen and reach the path toward Soldier's home at the other side.
